    <b>Biography:</b> <br>
    This is a very thorough biography on Bill Gates. Bill Gates is a super rich guy. He is the guy that made the company called
    Microsoft. Microsoft is a multibillion dollar company that made huge impacts on the world. This guy dropped out of Harvard to
    create this multibillion dollar company. He was studying computer science in college, but found that he could spend his free time more
    effectively by pursuing with his company rather than staying in school. He is no longer working for Microsoft. He is now a philanthropist.</p>
